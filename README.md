## Personal Goals for Project

For the tic-tac-toe project, my front end was really basic and was lacking in "prettiness". For this project, I really wanted to dive more into bootstrap and utilize bootstrap to increase the readability of my page.

In addition, I didn't get to do much with array iteration methods in the tic-tac-toe projects. For this project, I wanted to design a user feature where I would have to interate over the birthdays object and display some type of useful information to the user. I did this by displaying how many birthdays the user has left this year.
